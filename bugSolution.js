The solution involves ensuring that your Android environment uses a compatible version of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP). You may need to update the AGP version or adjust your project's Gradle configuration to align with Expo's requirements.  If updating the AGP version doesn't resolve the issue, you might need to inspect your project's dependencies for other conflicts.  To achieve compatibility, one effective method is to create a new project to ensure a clean environment and thus avoid any dependency conflicts.
