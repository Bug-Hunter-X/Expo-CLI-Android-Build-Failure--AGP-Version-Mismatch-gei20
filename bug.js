This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error related to the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version incompatibility. Specifically, it points to a version conflict between the AGP version required by Expo and the AGP version already installed in your Android Studio environment.  The error message usually mentions something about a required AGP version that's incompatible with the existing one.
